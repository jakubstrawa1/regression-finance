This is a data science project with regression problem that predicts the amount based on cost centre, account type, date etc.
For this model i've also used the GridSearchCV pipeline trick with dictionary and hyperparameters, 
which immensely helps with tuning and finding the best optimal algorithm (in this case from randomforst, lasso, ridge, elasticnet and gradientboosting)
This ipynb presents lots of data visualisation, correlations, violinplots and heatmaps. 
In this project i've used high level techniques for data processing such as one hot encoding with pd.get_dummies(), dropping/filling columns/rows,
changing dtypes.
